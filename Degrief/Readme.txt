To install, extract Degrief into the server's mods folder: \Mods\
Then add "Mods/Degrief" to the server's mods config file: \Config\mods.txt
e.g.

Mods

	"Mods/Degrief"
	"Game/Dev"
	"Game/Survival"
	"Game/Creative"
	"Game/Core"
}

I would like to thank:
	StilleVande: for allowing me to test this mod on his server.
